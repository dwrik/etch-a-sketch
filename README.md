# Etch-A-Sketch

A paint/sketch like application where the canvas gets colored by hovering over it.

This project has been built as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/home) full stack curriculum that am currently undertaking.
The project has been built as an exercise to practise `html`, `css`, `javascript` and `dom-manipulation` skills.
